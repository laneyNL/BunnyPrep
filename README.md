<h1>Bunny Prep</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
Bunny Prep is an interactive, educational 2D game that will teach you how to care for your rabbit. The user begins the game by choosing a rabbit to adopt. Prompts will then give on what tasks need to be completed to keep their rabbit happy. As the game progresses the user will be taught different facts about rabbit care and will be linked to different resources to learn more. If a rabbit’s happiness gauge falls to 0, the user will lose the game.

</ul>
<h2>Technologies, Libraries, APIs</h2>


<ul>
  <li>Canvas API will be used to render the room and animate the movements of the rabbit.</li>
  <li>Webpack to compile our modules.</li>
  <li>Babel to transpile files to be supported by older browsers.</li>
  <li>npm</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementation Timeline</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Prep before project begins: </b>Become familiar with Canvas API. Create the project files and determine the file structure for the project.</li>
  <li><b>Day 1: </b>Create underlying logic for the game that will keep track of all variables and display items.</li>
  <li><b>Day 2: </b>Test the basic game logic to ensure the game is running as intended.</li>
  <li><b>Day 3: </b>Create designs for the room and rabbit.</li>
  <li><b>Day 4: </b>Incorporate the designs for the room and rabbit to the logic. Work on all displays.</li>
  <li><b>Day 5: </b>Test the overall game to make sure all functions are working as intended. Add more more complex game tasks and add to the game.</li>
  <li><b>Day 6: </b>Add all rabbit care facts and link to resources for the user to learn more about rabbit care.</li>
  <li><b>Day 7:</b>Work out all the bugs in the game and incorporate bonus features if there is time. Deploy to github.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allow the user to choose between an idealistic and realistic mode. (Idealistic mode will hide more dangerous situations a rabbit might encounter in real life. This is better for a younger user.)</li>
  <li>Allow the user to adopt a friend.</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Simulate the dangers that come with not spaying or neutering your pet. 
  </ul>
  <li>Incorporate an adoption website’s API to display real rabbits available for adoption.</li>
</ul>
