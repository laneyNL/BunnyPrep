<h1>Bunny Prep</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
Bunny Prep is an interactive, educational 2D game that will teach you how to care for your rabbit. The user begins the game by choosing a rabbit to adopt. Prompts will then give on what tasks need to be completed to keep their rabbit happy and healthy. As the game progresses the user will be taught different facts about rabbit care and will be linked to different resources to learn more. If a rabbit’s happiness gauge falls to 0, the user will lose the game.


<h2>Functionality & MVPs</h2>
 In Bunny Prep, the user's will be able to: 
 <ul>
    <li>Move the rabbit with the cursor to complete assigned tasks. </li>
    <li>Make choices in the game that will impact the rabbit's happiness and health. </li>
    <li>Allow the user to adopt another rabbit if happiness reaches a certain level. Simulation the consquences of not spaying/neutering.</li>
    <li>Learn how to care for a rabbit through educational knowledge that pops up throughout the game.</li>
  </ul>
In addition, this project will include:
  <ul>
    <li>A rabbit happiness gauge that will change based on the user's actions.</li>
    <li>A running total cost tally to emphasize the monetary commitments of owning a rabbit.</li>
    <li>A sidebar with all facts learned throughout the game.</li>
  </ul>

<ul>
  <li>Rabbit name will display the user’s chosen rabbit name</li>
  <li>Happiness gauge will display the rabbit’s level of happiness out of 10.</li>
  <li>Total cost bar that will show the user the running total cost of owning a rabbit. </li>
  <li>The task bar will display to the user the current task that should be completed to progress in the game.</li>
  <li>The play area display will be where the user can interact with the rabbit.</li>
  <li>The right side will display a sidebar will all the facts the user has learned so far about rabbit care.</li>
  <li>The bottom will display links to the GitHub repo for the project and my LinkedIn page.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies, Libraries, APIs</h2>


<ul>
  <li>Canvas API will be used to render the room and animate the movements of the rabbit.</li>
  <li>Webpack, Bable, and npm to compile our modules and to transpile files to be supported by older browsers.</li>
  <li>Google Fonts for the text.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation Timeline</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Prep before project begins: </b>Become familiar with Canvas API. Create the project files and determine the file structure for the project.</li>
  <li><b>Day 1: </b>Create the underlying game logic functions for the game and lessons classes.</li>
  <li><b>Day 2: </b>Continue developing the basic framework to run the game. Unit and integration tests for the game and lessons code to ensure the game is running as intended.</li>
  <li><b>Day 3: </b>Create designs for the room and rabbit.</li>
  <li><b>Day 4: </b>Incorporate the designs for the room and rabbit to the game play. Work on all displays.</li>
  <li><b>Day 5: </b>Integration testing to make sure all functions are working as intended. Add more more complex game tasks and add to the game.</li>
  <li><b>Day 6: </b>Add all rabbit care facts and link to resources for the user to learn more about rabbit care.</li>
  <li><b>Day 7:</b>Work out all the bugs in the game and incorporate bonus features if there is time. Deploy to github.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bonus Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allow the user to choose between an idealistic and realistic mode. (Idealistic mode will hide more dangerous situations a rabbit might encounter in real life. This is better for a younger user.)</li>
  <li>Incorporate an adoption website’s API to display real rabbits available for adoption.</li>
</ul>
